! Original Keychron K7 keymaps
! -------------------------
! capslock = 66
! tilde    = 49
! escape   = 9

! Explanation of keysyms list
! ---------------------------
! The first keysym is used when no modifier key is pressed in conjunction with this key, the second with Shift, the third when the Mode_switch key is used with this key and the fourth when both the Mode_switch and Shift keys are used. 

! Caps_Lock is a modifier key, must be treated differently
clear lock
! BELOW LINE IS BROKEN: second keysym re-triggers capslock without modifier key, likely because they're both modifier keys
! keycode 66 = Escape Caps_Lock
keycode 66 = Escape
keycode 49 = Caps_Lock
keycode  9 = asciitilde grave
add lock = Caps_Lock
